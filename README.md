# R-prog-Assigment-2
Script for the Assigment 2 in the R-programming Coursera course May 2015

Example matrices:
  1: Mat<-matrix(c(3,1,6,9,4,2,6,8,9),nrow=3,ncol=3)
  2: Mat<-matrix(c(5,3,8,6,1,9,10,45,3,17,32,23,5,12,9,18),nrow=4,ncol=4)
  3: Mat<-matrix(rnorm(100),nrow=10,ncol=10)
  
Test: the matrix (Mat) multiplied with the resulting inversed matrix (InvMat): Mat%*%InMat must give a matrix with all diagonal element = 1 and all other elements = 0
